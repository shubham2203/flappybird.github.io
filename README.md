# Flappy Bird

"Flappy Bird" is a classic arcade-style game developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal of the game is to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without hitting them. The bird is constantly moving upward and players must keep the bird from falling by tapping the screen to make it fly higher. The game has a retro design and simple gameplay, making it both challenging and fun. The player's score increases every time they successfully pass through a set of pipes, adding to the overall replay value.
